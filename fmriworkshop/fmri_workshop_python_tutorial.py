# Importing Modules
    
# Modules are Python .py files that consist of Python code. Any Python file can be referenced as a module. 
# for example, a Python file called hello.py has the module name of hello that can be imported into other Python files, or used on the Python command line interpreter.
# Modules can define functions, classes, and variables that you can reference in other Python .py files or via the Python command line interpreter. 
# In Python, modules are accessed by using the import statement. When you do this, you execute the code of the module, keeping the scopes of the definitions so that your current file(s) can make use of these.

"""
It is possible to modify the names of modules and their functions within Python by using the as keyword.

You may want to change a name because you have already used the same name for something else in your program, another module you have imported also uses that name, 
or you may want to abbreviate a longer name that you are using a lot.
